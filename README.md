Example PCA using Eigenfaces

In this repository, I created a small example of the principal component analysis (PCA) for my seminaral thesis in Biosensorik. For the example, I used the Yale Dataset which I obtained from their website http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html. The cool thing about Eigenfaces is that the computed eigenvectors can be interpreted as images - the Eigenfaces.

Dataset

The data set consist of faces of 15 different people. Each person was photographed in 12 different facial expressions.



Reference

The first paper using the approach of Eigenfaces is "Face Recognition Using Eigenfaces" by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland which is online available https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/mturk-CVPR91.pdf
